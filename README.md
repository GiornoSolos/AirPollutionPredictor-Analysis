Air Quality Index (AQI) Prediction System
A machine learning solution for predicting Air Quality Index using real-time pollutant measurements and temporal features, designed to support scalable AQI monitoring in environments with incomplete sensor data.
 Project Objective
This project develops a robust machine learning model that accurately predicts the Air Quality Index (AQI) using a subset of real-time pollutant measurements and temporal features. The primary goal is to enable real-time AQI estimation in scenarios where complete sensor data may be unavailable, thereby improving the scalability and efficiency of air quality monitoring systems.
 Dataset Overview
The dataset comprises hourly pollution data collected from air quality monitoring stations across multiple cities in India, featuring:
Data Features

Numeric Pollutant Measurements: PM2.5, PM10, NOx, SO2, CO, O3, Benzene, NH₃, NO₂
Categorical Identifiers: Station ID, Station Name, City, State, Status
Temporal Information: Datetime and Date fields
Target Variables:

AQI: Continuous Air Quality Index values
AQI_Bucket: Ordinal classifications ("Good", "Satisfactory", "Moderate", "Poor", "Very Poor", "Severe")



Data Characteristics

Scale: Hourly measurements from multiple monitoring stations
Geographic Coverage: Multiple cities across India
Missing Data: Varies by feature (15-48% for some pollutants)

 Data Preprocessing & Cleaning
Feature Selection

Removed: Xylene due to >50% missing data
Retained: All other pollutant measurements with manageable missing data rates

Missing Value Treatment

Numeric Features: Applied SimpleImputer with median strategy for variables with 15-48% missing values (NH₃, PM10, NO₂, SO₂)
Categorical Features: Imputed Status using mode strategy
Target Variables: Excluded rows with missing AQI or AQI_Bucket values (~22% of data) to prevent bias introduction

Data Quality Assurance

Comprehensive missing data analysis
Outlier detection and handling
Data consistency validation across temporal and geographic dimensions

 Feature Engineering
Temporal Feature Extraction

Hour of Day: Extracted from Datetime field
Month: Seasonal patterns identification
Weekday: Weekly cyclical patterns
Rush Hour Indicators: Peak traffic period flags
Seasonal Indicators: Quarterly seasonal classification

Advanced Temporal Encoding

Cyclical Encoding: Applied to hour-of-day features to preserve periodic nature of time
Temporal Harmonics: Sine and cosine transformations for continuous temporal representation

Feature Selection Strategy

Removed target leakage by excluding one of AQI/AQI_Bucket (highly correlated)
Intentionally avoided categorical encoding for station/location data to maintain real-time prediction capability
Focused on numeric pollutant measurements for scalability

 Machine Learning Approach
Problem Formulation

Task Type: Multi-class classification
Target: AQI_Bucket ordinal categories
Prediction Strategy: Real-time classification using available sensor subset

Data Splitting Strategy
Training Set:   70% of data
Validation Set:  5% of data  
Test Set:       25% of data
Model Architecture

Classification Framework: Multi-class classification for AQI bucket prediction
Feature Space: Numeric pollutant measurements + engineered temporal features
Real-time Capability: Designed to handle partial sensor data scenarios
